# Contributing to study-guide

First off, thank you for considering contributing to study-guide :tada:. Following these guidelines help to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalise your pull requests.

### Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug, have a question or just want to add a new study content, [search the issue tracker](https://github.com/kosyfrances/study-guide/issues?q=something) to see if
someone else has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and
[make one](https://github.com/kosyfrances/study-guide/issues/new)!

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork study-guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and
create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #225 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 225-add-new-topic
```

### Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help;
everyone is a beginner at first.

### Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code
has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

### Merging a PR (maintainers only)

A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer if it is approved.
