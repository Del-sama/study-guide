# Practice projects
### Even or odd
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

**Concepts to keep in mind:**
* If/Else statements
* Input/Output
* Modular arithmetic (the modulus operator)
* Print

### Dice rolling simulator
This project involves writing a program that simulates rolling a die. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6 and print, then ask the user if they will like to roll again.

**Concepts to keep in mind:**
* Random
* Integer
* Print
* While loops

### Guess the number
The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.

**Concepts to keep in mind:**
* Random function
* Integers
* Input/Output
* Print
* While loops
* If/Else statements
